# Challenge 1: SQL Injection Exploitation

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this challenge was to exploit a SQL Injection vulnerability in a web application to retrieve user credentials, crack a password hash, and access a protected file on the target system.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
- Web browser
- Password hash cracking tool

---

## 🧪 Methodology
1. Identified vulnerable input fields within the web application.
2. Enumerated database tables and columns using SQL injection payloads.
3. Retrieved the username and password hash of the target user.
4. Cracked the password hash.
5. Logged into the target system using the compromised credentials.
6. Located and opened the file containing the challenge flag.
