# Challenge 4: Network Traffic (PCAP) Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze captured network traffic in a PCAP file to identify sensitive information transmitted in clear text.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Wireshark
- Web browser

---

## 🧪 Methodology
1. Opened and analyzed the PCAP file using Wireshark.
2. Identified the target IP address from captured traffic.
3. Extracted URLs and file paths from HTTP packets.
4. Accessed exposed directories via a web browser.
5. Located and reviewed sensitive data.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- How network traffic analysis reveals sensitive information
- Risks of transmitting data in clear text
- Importance of encryption in modern networks

---

## 🔐 Remediation Recommendations
- Encrypt data in transit (HTTPS, TLS)
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement strict access controls (ACLs / RBAC)
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies
