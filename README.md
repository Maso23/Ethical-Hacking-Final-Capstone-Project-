# Ethical Hacking Capstone Project

This repository documents my Ethical Hacking Capstone Project, completed as part of a cybersecurity course. The project focuses on identifying, exploiting, and remediating common security vulnerabilities in a controlled and ethical lab environment.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Perform real-world penetration testing techniques
- Identify system and application vulnerabilities
- Understand attacker methodologies
- Propose remediation strategies
- Strengthen defensive cybersecurity awareness

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Kali Linux
- Nmap
- Nikto
- enum4linux
- Wireshark
- SQL Injection techniques
- Linux command-line tools

---

## 🧪 Challenge 1: SQL Injection

### Objective
Exploit a vulnerable web application to extract user credentials, crack password hashes, and access protected files.

### Key Activities
- Database and table enumeration
- SQL injection exploitation
- Password hash cracking
- Secure remediation research

### 🔐 Remediation
- Parameterized queries
- Input validation
- Least privilege
- Generic error handling
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)

---

## 🌐 Challenge 2: Web Server Vulnerabilities

### Objective
Identify web server misconfigurations that expose directory listings and sensitive files.

### Key Activities
- Web server reconnaissance
- Directory enumeration
- Manual URL manipulation
- Flag discovery

### 🔐 Remediation
- Disable directory indexing
- Add default index files
- Restrict file permissions
- Remove sensitive files from web root

---

## 🗂️ Challenge 3: Exploiting Open SMB Shares

### Objective
Identify and access unsecured SMB shares available to anonymous users.

### Key Activities
- SMB service discovery
- Share enumeration
- Anonymous access testing
- Sensitive file retrieval


### 🔐 Remediation
- Firewall rules & network segmentation
- Disable SMBv1
- Enforce SMB signing and authentication

---

## 📡 Challenge 4: PCAP Traffic Analysis

### Objective
Analyze captured network traffic to identify sensitive data transmitted in clear text.

### Key Activities
- PCAP file analysis using Wireshark
- Target IP identification
- URL and file discovery
- Sensitive data exposure analysis

### 🔐 Remediation
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- Implement strict access controls (ACLs / RBAC)

---

## ⚖️ Ethical Disclaimer
All activities were performed in a controlled lab environment strictly for educational purposes. No unauthorized systems were tested.
